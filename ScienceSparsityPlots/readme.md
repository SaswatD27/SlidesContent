# Sparsity Plots
All of these plots are interactive. Click on the legend to select/delect lines. Files prefixed with "Interpolated" are lineplots made with interpolation over sparsity values.

Plot_1 is made w.r.t. the variables "PUMA", "SEX", "AGE", "RACE", "OWNERSHP", "INCTOT", whereas Plot_2 is made w.r.t. "PUMA", "SEX", "RACE", "OWNERSHP", "INCTOT".
